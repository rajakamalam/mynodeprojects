1. Once the application has been built, we will need to help all the users from anywhere to access

In order to do this, we are attemoting to use two applications GIT and Heroku.

GIT:
1. We will use GIT to upload all our code to a public directory 


Heroku:
For a node application to start in the terminal we use node app.js.. This means that, the app.js is the 
first file to run in an application. While deploying in Heroku, the same thing happens. We will 
configure heroku to then run app.js 
For these steps to happen, the following steps have to be taken 
Step 1: Set up your own customized Heroku space
Step 2: Make changes in the package.json file under scripts 
"scripts" : {
    "start" : "node src/app.js"
}
We can do the above, locally as well by giving command "npm run start"
Step 3: Make the following in "app.js" file
app.listen(port, () => {
   console.log('Server is up on port ' + port)
})
Step 4: Change the following line from the js file inside JS folder 
fetch('http://localhost:3000/weather?address=' + encodeURIComponent(location)).then((response) => {}
